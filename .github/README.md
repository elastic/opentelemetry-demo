The following guide describes how to setup the OpenTelemetry demo with Elastic Observability using [Docker compose](#docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](#kubernetes). This fork introduces several changes to the agents used in the demo:

- The Java agent within the [Ad](../src/ad/Dockerfile.elastic), the [Fraud Detection](../src/fraud-detection/Dockerfile.elastic) and the [Kafka](../src/kafka/Dockerfile.elastic) services have been replaced with the Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry Java Agent. You can find more information about the Elastic distribution in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-distribution-opentelemetry-java-agent).
- The .NET agent within the [Cart service](../src/cart/src/Directory.Build.props) has been replaced with the Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry .NET Agent. You can find more information about the Elastic distribution in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-dotnet-applications).
- The Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry Node.js Agent has replaced the OpenTelemetry Node.js agent in the [Payment service](../src/payment/package.json). Additional details about the Elastic distribution are available in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-node-js).
- The Elastic distribution for OpenTelemetry Python has replaced the OpenTelemetry Python agent in the [Recommendation service](../src/recommendation/requirements.txt). Additional details about the Elastic distribution are available in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-python).

Additionally, the OpenTelemetry Contrib collector has also been changed to the [Elastic OpenTelemetry Collector distribution](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/internal/pkg/otel/README.md). This ensures a more integrated and optimized experience with Elastic Observability.

## Docker compose

1. Start a free trial on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and copy the `Elasticsearch endpoint` and the `API Key` from the `Help -> Connection details` drop down instructions in your Kibana. These variables will be used by the [elasticsearch exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter#elasticsearch-exporter) to authenticate and transmit data to your Elasticsearch instance.
2. Open the file `src/otel-collector/otelcol-elastic-config.yaml` in an editor and replace all occurrences the following two placeholders:
   - `YOUR_ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT`: your Elasticsearch endpoint (*with* `https://` prefix example: `https://1234567.us-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com:443`).
   - `YOUR_ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`: your Elasticsearch API Key
3. Start the demo with the following command from the repository's root directory:
   ```
   make start
   ```

## Kubernetes
### Prerequisites:
- Create a Kubernetes cluster. There are no specific requirements, so you can create a local one, or use a managed Kubernetes cluster, such as [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), or [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service).
- Set up [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/).
- Set up [Helm](https://helm.sh/).


### Start the Demo (Kubernetes deployment)
1. Setup Elastic Observability on Elastic Cloud.
2. Create a secret in Kubernetes with the following command.
   ```
   kubectl create secret generic elastic-secret-otel \
     --from-literal=elastic_endpoint='YOUR_ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT' \
     --from-literal=elastic_api_key='YOUR_ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY'
   ```
   Don't forget to replace
   - `YOUR_ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT`: your Elasticsearch endpoint (*with* `https://` prefix example: `https://1234567.us-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com:443`).
   - `YOUR_ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`: your Elasticsearch API Key
3. Execute the following commands to deploy the OpenTelemetry demo to your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```
   # clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo

   # switch to the kubernetes/elastic-helm directory
   cd opentelemetry-demo/kubernetes/elastic-helm

   # !(when running it for the first time) add the open-telemetry Helm repostiroy
   helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts

   # !(when an older helm open-telemetry repo exists) update the open-telemetry helm repo
   helm repo update open-telemetry

   # deploy the demo through helm install
   helm install -f deployment.yaml my-otel-demo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo
   ```

Additionally, this EDOT Collector configuration includes the following components for comprehensive Kubernetes monitoring:
  - [K8s Objects Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/k8sobjectsreceiver): Captures detailed information about Kubernetes objects.
  - [K8s Cluster Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/k8sclusterreceiver): Collects metrics and metadata about the overall cluster state.

#### Kubernetes monitoring (daemonset)

The `daemonset` EDOT collector is configured with the components to monitor node-level metrics and logs, ensuring detailed insights into individual Kubernetes nodes:

- [Host Metrics Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetrics): Collects system-level metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage from the host.
- [Kubelet Stats Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kubeletstats): Gathers pod and container metrics directly from the kubelet.
- [Filelog Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelog): Ingests and parses log files from nodes, providing detailed log analysis.

To deploy the EDOT Collector to your Kubernetes cluster, ensure the `elastic-secret-otel` Kubernetes secret is created (if it doesn't already exist). Then, run the following command from the `kubernetes/elastic-helm` directory in this repository.

```
# deploy the Elastic OpenTelemetry collector distribution through helm install
helm install otel-daemonset open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector --values daemonset.yaml
```
