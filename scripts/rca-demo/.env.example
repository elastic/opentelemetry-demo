# NOTE: http://host.minikube.internal and http://host.docker.internal are BOTH
# valid domains for reaching your machine's localhost from inside the minikube container.
#
# So if you are running APM server locally on localhost:8200, and you want your minikube
# to be able to access that domain, you need to use http://host.minikube.internal:8200
# from within the minikube container and it should work.

# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
#
# This is the endpoint for your OTLP collector, which could be an 
# APM server instance or another OTel collector endpoint
#
# e.g. "http://host.minikube.internal:8200"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=""

# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
#
# If your OTLP collector / APM server endpoint is guarded by auth, you will need
# to provide the correct header value, e.g. "Authorization=Bearer some_token_2241_here"
# or "Authorization=ApiKey some_api_key_here"
#
# However, if your OTLP endpoint requires no authorization, these headers are still
# expected by the script, even though they will be ignored by the OTLP collector.
# For that reason, just use "Authorization=Bearer none" to bypass this requirement.
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=""

# OTEL_DEMO_ES_ENDPOINT
#
# This is the endpoint for Elasticsearch, it should be the same ES that your
# OTLP collector is configured to connect to, and the same ES that your
# Kibana is configured to connect to, so that the demo works across all products.
#
# e.g. http://host.minikube.internal:9200
export OTEL_DEMO_ES_ENDPOINT=""

# OTEL_DEMO_ES_API_KEY
#
# Your Elasticsearch instance is likely set up with security enabled, which means
# you will need an ES API key to interact with it. For help on creating an
# API key, visit https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-create-api-key.html
#
# NOTE: This should be the Base64 encoded version that is returned as "encoded" 
# from the create API endpoint, or as the only value in the UI.
export OTEL_DEMO_ES_API_KEY=""

# TLS_INSECURE
#
# For most local dev scenarios, you need to specify tls.insecure: true in the
# collector config (in both kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml and in 
# kubernetes/elastic-helm/daemonset.yaml) â€” this will do that for you.
export TLS_INSECURE="true"

# KIBANA_URL
#
# URL where your connected Kibana is running (with basepath)
# e.g. http://localhost:5601/xyz
export KIBANA_URL=""

# KIBANA_USER and KIBANA_PASSWORD
#
# Provide a user and password combo that can be used to interact with
# Kibana REST APIs, this user should have "admin" access.
export KIBANA_USER=""
export KIBANA_PASSWORD=""
